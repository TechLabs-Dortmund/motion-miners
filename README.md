# Motion Miners: "People flow analysis in a vaccination center"

This project was developed in collaboration with Motionminers GmbH, who provided us with the data for the analysis.
In the project **"People flow analysis in a vaccination centre"** we analyse the flow times of people who have received a vaccination in the vaccination centre. Through the code you have the possibility to discover bottlenecks in the system and to clarify them through a visual representation

## What you need

In order to run the code, you need few things.

```bash
  - pickle file which contains the tracer data from motion miners
  - layout.json file from motion miners
